I want a better overall look. it needs to look very bold but also very clean. Shades of grey -> black for accents / buttons. The background needs to be white. Animations need to be slick and smooth. the inline edit is still not good. too many text boxes. when you create a tile, just show placeholders without borders. no submit button. Enter or a click outside saves it. Esc dismisses. Also looks like you removed the filters and Layout change. bring it back. One done print DONE --completion-text=DONE
