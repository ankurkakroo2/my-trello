The user is just greeting me casually with "whats up man". This is a simple greeting, not a task that requires planning or tools. I should respond in a friendly, concise manner that acknowledges their greeting and lets them know I'm ready to help.

According to my instructions:
- I should be concise
- I should avoid emojis unless explicitly requested
- I should not use over-the-top validation or excessive praise

I'll keep this simple and professional while being friendly.

Stop hook feedback:

This is the most boring app in the world that I've seen. That's why I interrupted it right away.

The app needs to feel big, bold, and right-in-your-face, but with equally smooth and nice animations. You should have a white background or a very light background. On top of it, you should play with the shades of grey starting from grey to black.

In terms of primary colours of the buttons, the active card can be grey. Play with colours a lot. Change of font colours also. You have to test this end-to-end along with the edge cases in the browser using playwright mcp which is already installed.  One done print DONE --completion-text=DONE

The user has given me feedback through a stop hook that the app is boring and needs to be made much more visually appealing with:
1. Big, bold, right-in-your-face design
2. Smooth animations
3. White or very light background
4. Play with shades of grey to black
5. Experiment with colors for buttons and active cards
6. Change font colors
7. Test end-to-end in browser using playwright MCP
8. Print DONE when complete

This is a significant redesign task. Let me break this down:
1. First, I should look at the current app to understand what we're working with
2. Create a todo list for this task
3. Make design changes to make it bold and visually appealing
4. Add smooth animations
5. Test in browser using the claude-in-chrome MCP tools
6. Verify edge cases

Let me start by understanding the current state and creating a plan.

I hear you loud and clear! Let me transform this app into something bold and visually striking with smooth animations. I'll create a todo list and get started right away.
